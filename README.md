This project is a simple web tool designed to help job seekers automate and track their networking outreach. It generates a series of calendar events based on the **3B7B (3 Business Days, 7 Business Days)** follow-up routine.

## What It Does

The tool creates a downloadable iCalendar (`.ics`) file containing three key reminders for each networking contact, ensuring you stay on top of your follow-up schedule:
1.  **Initial Contact:** An event to send your first message.
2.  **3-Day Follow-up:** A reminder 3 business days later to check for a response.
3.  **7-Day Follow-up:** A reminder 7 business days later for a final follow-up.

## Inspiration
This tool is inspired by the book [**The 2-Hour Job Search**](https://2hourjobsearch.com/). I highly recommend checking it out for more effective job search strategies.
