    "# 3B7B Calendar Event Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python script generates a series of calendar events based on the 3B7B (3 Business Days, 7 Business Days) routine for job search outreach. The script creates an iCalendar file containing three events:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An initial event to send the first email to a job search contact\n",
    "2. A reminder event 3 business days later to check if the contact has responded, and if not, to reach out to a new contact\n",
    "3. A reminder event 7 business days later to send a follow-up email to the contact if no response has been received\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3B7B routine is a systematic approach to managing job search outreach and follow-ups. By setting reminders and scheduling events, the routine helps job seekers stay organized and persistent in their outreach efforts, while also being mindful of potential contacts' time and responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this script, you need to have Python installed, along with the following libraries:\n",
    "- `python-dateutil`\n",
    "- `icalendar`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install these libraries using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install python-dateutil icalendar`\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate the calendar events, simply run the script and modify the `contact_name`, `contact_email`, and `start_date` variables in the \"Change here usage\" section at the bottom of the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `start_date` can be set to tomorrow's date by default, or you can specify a custom date in the format `'YYYY-MM-DD'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the script, an `.ics` file will be generated with the name `{contact_name}_3b7b_reminders.ics`. You can import this file into your preferred calendar application (e.g., Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook) to view and manage the scheduled events.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Customization\n",
    "\n",
    "You can customize the event details, such as the summary, description, and time, by modifying the corresponding lines in the `create_3b7b_events()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to fork this repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests. Your contributions are welcome!\n",
